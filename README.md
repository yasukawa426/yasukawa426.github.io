## Heeeeeyy

This is just a personal site where I share stuff about me, including but not limited to, my thoughts and hobbies. I try to be very honest and share stuff that I don't really talk with nobody in my life, so please, don't judge me. Also, I hope people I know in person don't access it... or do, idk. While I am writting it for myself, I also kinda hope people read it and maybe even share their thoughts about it.

Things that I am using on it:

- [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to run some scripts I wrote in python whenever I push to this repo.
- [GitHub APIs](https://docs.github.com/) to load commits data.
- I used [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to make some games that I have on the site.
- [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) for GitHub Issues based comment section.

Tech stack:
Just plain old html, css and javascript. I also wrote some python scripts for indexing and to load my steam games list, but that's it. I try to avoid using any framework and libraries. My IDE is VsCode with tons of extensions. The site is hosted using GitHub Pages. Maybe I will change it in the future, but idk.

I took some inspiration from both these sites: [Ulillillia City](https://web.archive.org/web/20160801020225/http://www.ulillillia.us/mainindex.shtml) and [sadgrl.online](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/) - as you can see in [cool stuff.txt](https://github.com/yasukawa426/yasukawa426.github.io/blob/main/cool%20stuff.txt).

I guess that's it, enjoy.
