                  Just took this picture while writting this page. Its 8am and I
                  have been around 24 hours awake. Who needs sleep anyway. And I
                  just realized my fingers look weirdly broken???
                </p>

            <p>
              I am random dude. Brazilian (I have no clue why I made the website
              completely in english), 24 years old (as of writting), male, and I
              have a degree in computer science. I identify as an
              <strong>e-boy</strong>, thought you wouldn't know by looking at
              me. Am very bad at writting, as you can see.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have never been someone very ambitious. I lived most of my life
              without having any dreams, and I think I still don't. Never
              thought much about the future as well. I just wish to be happy
              (whatever that means), manage to survive without working a lot of
              hours and be surround by people that care about and love me (still
              working on that. Have very good friends tho).
            </p>
            <p>
              One good and at the same time bad thing about me, is that I am
              very good at ignoring my problems, something that am I trying to
              get worse at hahahhahahahahaha.
            </p>

            <p>I have two overweight cats.</p>
            <h2>MY FRAKIGN CATS</h2>
            <img
              id="cat1"
              src="/resources/images/cats/morceguinha_on_top.jpg"

            />
            <p id="image-description">Roberto and Morceguinha</p>
            <p>
              The black one is female and is called Morceguinha. The white and
              brown one is male and is called Roberto. They look like they are
              very close but the are aways fighting. Roberto always want to lick
              Morceguinha but she hates it. Whenever he does it, she starts
              biting him and then they start fighting. Its so funny.
            </p>

            <p>
              My mom and I adopted Morceguinha when she was around 2 months old
              from my mom's friend. We found Roberto on the street, meowing for
              food as we were coming back from voting. We brought him some
              kibble, took him to the vet, gave him a bath, and got him
              vaccinated. He‚Äôs been with us ever since. I have a photo that we
              took on the day we found him, buy unfurtunely, I couldn't find it.

          <div id="qualities-and-defects-section">
            <h1>Qualities and Flaws</h1>
            <p>
              So... What are my qualities and flaws? Actually, I have a hard
              time thinking about my qualities so I will start with the flaws.
            </p>
            <p>
              What are my flaws? What am I bad at? What do I dislike about
              myself? Here they are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Lazy: </strong> I can be very lazy. Not do things
                because its too much work. Not studying, doing chores, getting
                out of my comfort zone, etc. I just skipped having a kiwi for
                breakfast because I would need to peel it. Bruh.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Ignoring my problems: </strong>I usually ignore my
                problems. While it means I don't let my problems affect me that
                much, it also means that I don't do anything to fix them, and
                that sucks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sticking with stuff: </strong>I have a hard time
                sticking with stuff. Like sticking with new hobbies, finishing
                projects, etc. I might even abandon this site, who knows?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Insecure: </strong>I guess I am not very secure/have low
                self-esteem? I often think that I am worse than other people -
                worse at something, don't look as good, and so on. I even avoid
                competiting because I think I would lose, and if lost while
                really trying it would be proof that I suck.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Coward?: </strong>I don't know if "coward" is the
                correct term, but I usually avoid doing thinks because of fear.
                Like, avoiding doing something new because I might fail.
                Avoiding confronting people for fear they might dislike me.
                Avoiding sharing my opnion so I don't get judged.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Bad at teaching: </strong>Kinda random, but I suck at
                teaching other people.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Too hard on myself: </strong> I am too hard on myself.
                Things I wouldn't care about in others I hate about myself. I
                judge my looks way too much and cringe at normal things I do or
                say.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Overweight: </strong>I am slightly overweight. üëç</li>
              <li>
                <strong>I can't see my qualities: </strong>As you might have
                already noticed by now, I really struggle to identify my
                qualities. I have a hard time saying/thinking good things about
                myself. idk what to tell you lol. It is what it is.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Horrible sleep schedule: </strong>I am insomniac. I have
                very very very hard time sleeping. Usually I take 1 to 2 hours
                to sleep. Sometimes I am not able to sleep at all, staying awake
                more than 24 hours straight. And even worse, sometimes when I
                finally manage to sleep, I sleep waaaay too much. Like, around
                11 hours. I hate this so much. I even tried taking melatonin,
                but even that didn't work. It makes me want to unalive myself if
                have something to do on that day. Again, it is what it is lmao
                lol laomodalsads.

                <strong>Secret: </strong>This one is a

                <strong>Smart: </strong>I guess I am slightly above average,
