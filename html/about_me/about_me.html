                Just took this picture while writting this page. Its 8am and I
                have been around 24 hours awake. Who needs sleep anyway. And I
                just realized my fingers look weirdly broken???

            I am random dude. Brazilian (I have no clue why I made the website
            completely in english), 24 years old (as of writting), male, and I
            have a degree in computer science. I identify as an
            <strong>e-boy</strong>, thought you wouldn't know by looking at me.
            Am very bad at writting, as you can see.

            I have never been someone very ambitious. I lived most of my life
            without having any dreams, and I think I still don't. Never thought
            much about the future as well. I just wish to be happy (whatever
            that means), manage to survive without working a lot of hours and be
            surround by people that care about and love me (still working on
            that. Have very good friends tho).
          </p>

            One good and at the same time bad thing about me, is that I am very
            good at ignoring my problems, something that am I trying to get
            worse at hahahhahahahahaha.

          <p>I have two overweight cats.</p>
          <h2>MY FRAKIGN CATS</h2>

            id="cat1"
            src="/resources/images/cats/morceguinha_on_top.jpg"
            alt="Morceguinha laying on top of Roberto"
          /><img
            id="cat2"

            alt="Morceguinha and Roberto sleepign together."
          />
          <p id="image-description">Roberto and Morceguinha</p>
          <p>
            The black one is female and is called Morceguinha. The white and
            brown one is male and is called Roberto. They look like they are
            very close but the are aways fighting. Roberto always want to lick
            Morceguinha but she hates it. Whenever he does it, she starts biting
            him and then they start fighting. Its so funny.
          </p>
          <video
            src="/resources/videos/fighting.mp4"
            controls
            style="height: 500px"
          ></video>
          <p>
            My mom and I adopted Morceguinha when she was around 2 months old
            from my mom's friend. We found Roberto on the street, meowing for
            food as we were coming back from voting. We brought him some kibble,
            took him to the vet, gave him a bath, and got him vaccinated. Heâ€™s
            been with us ever since. I have a photo that we took on the day we
            found him, buy unfurtunely, I couldn't find it.
