            This dream has very little logic, a lot of parts make no sense, and
            it only works in the dream world.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went to a cabin in the woods (though it was more like a big house
            in the middle of nowhere; in Portuguese, I’d call it a "sítio," but
            I’m not sure what the best word in English would be) with a group of
            people. I say "a group of people" because, throughout the dream, who
            they were kept changing. It felt like they were multiple people at
            the same time.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went to the cabin with my ex and her family, but I don't remember
            much of what happened. Fast forward to the end of the day: we were
            about to go to sleep, and her family suddenly turned into two of her
            friends, and then into random, unknown people. We were trying to
            decide where we would sleep. There were only two bedrooms, so "we"
            decided that one of the rooms would go to a couple (two of my
            real-life friends), while the rest of us would share a very large
            bed in the other room.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, there I was, lying in bed with people I didn’t know, feeling
            very uncomfortable but pretending not to be. The order in the bed,
            from left to right, was: a woman, a little girl (about 8 years old,
            who I believe was the woman’s daughter), a man, and me. There may
            have been one more person on the far left, but I’m not sure.
          </p>

          <p>
            This part of the dream was just me trying to fall asleep. At this
            point, I woke up a couple of times in real life and then fell back
            asleep, so dream and reality began to blur. In the dream, I was
            getting frustrated as I struggled to fall asleep, just like I do in
            real life. Eventually, I gave up. I think I got my laptop and
            started using it but was worried about the lights and sounds
            bothering the others. After a while, I noticed the man beside me was
            also struggling to fall asleep.
          </p>

          <h2>Then three events happened, but I’m not sure when or how:</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>
              A man (one of my ex’s friends) entered the room. One of the people
              I was sleeping with handed me a plate they had used and asked me
              to bring it to the kitchen. I didn’t want to and asked if I could
              just leave it on the bedside table. They agreed, but then they
              gave me something else. Again, I didn’t want to bring it to the
              kitchen, so I asked if I could leave it on the dresser. I got out
              of bed and put the object on the dresser, but they started getting
              mad, saying it would fall. Confused and annoyed, I decided to just
              take it to the kitchen after all. When I walked through the door,
              I was suddenly on a beach. It was gray and lifeless, almost like
              the beach in <em>Death Stranding</em>, though a bit better. It
              didn’t really bother me. I started running toward somewhere
              unknown while people cheered me on. The next thing I remember, I
              was back in the bedroom, lying on the bed.
            </li>

            <li>
              I somehow discovered that the man beside me was blind. There was
              also a blind woman outside the bedroom; they were married. She
              entered the room and stood by the bed. The man immediately knew
              she was there and that she was his wife. They exchanged a few
              words, and I remember feeling happy for them. The woman then left.
              I was impressed by how they both could recognize each other and
              function so well despite being blind. I wanted to tell the man how
              impressed I was, but I decided against it.
            </li>

            <li>
              I was in a car with my ex and her family, heading to the cabin. We
              saw luxury sports cars speeding down the road, led by a very
              muscular woman who looked exactly like LeanBeefPatty (a YouTuber).
              I remember hearing on the news that these people were fleeing or
              had stolen the cars or something like that.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I don’t remember what exactly happened next—maybe I had a
            disagreement with the man, or someone else did—but I decided to
            leave the house. At this point, the group of people had turned into
            a mix of my own relatives and strangers. As I was leaving, someone
            got shot. I rushed back inside, only to discover that my uncle had
            been shot and killed. Strangely, we didn’t take it too seriously. I
            saw my ex and started kissing her face, but as I did, she slowly
            turned into a man who resembled her.
          </p>

          <p>
            I noticed a revolver at his waist and grabbed it, yelling, "It was
            him!" The man reacted by grabbing the gun with his finger on the
            trigger. We started struggling, and a few shots were fired. I kept
            trying to push the gun away so it wouldn’t be aimed at me or anyone
            else. Eventually, I hit the man’s knee and heard the sound of bones
            breaking. The others joined in, and together we beat him up.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead of calling the police, we decided to burn the entire place
            down with him inside. But instead of using fire, we poured lava all
            over the ground, creating a river of lava that covered everything.
            My father and I hurried to leave, but I was worried about my stuff.
            I went back to the bedroom to grab my slightly burned belongings (my
            laptop, charger, and backpack), and while I was there, I found
            someone’s phone. I grabbed it and left.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the car, I asked my dad if he knew whose phone it was. He told me
            it belonged to someone in the family. When I unlocked the phone, I
            saw an Imgur page with a screenshot of a conversation where the
            owner had planned my uncle’s murder. There was also a WhatsApp
            conversation with a video of the murder and them celebrating. I told
            my dad what I’d found, and for some reason, he was weirdly happy, as
            if he had known all along. He dropped me off at my house, where I
            was greeted by my grandma and my cousin (my uncle’s daughter). My
            cousin greeted me as she usually does but then suddenly became sad,
            saying her father had died. I had completely forgotten about it. I
            offered my condolences, and I think I woke up at this point. There
            might have been more to the dream, but I don’t remember.
