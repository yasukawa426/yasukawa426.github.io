              It all started with me either being at my old house (the one I
              lived in when I was a kid) waiting to go to school, or already
              being at school. I decided to order a pizza. However, after I
              paid, I realized I had put in the wrong address. I managed to fix
              it, no problem, but when the pizza arrived, it actually turned
              into an
              <strong>Uber bike ride</strong>. (Not sure if you guys have that
              outside of Brazil. It's basically an Uber ride on a motorcycle
              instead of a car. You ride on the back, holding onto the driver).
            </p>
            <p>
              It started taking me home (So if I wasn’t already at school, I
              suddenly teleported there. Dream logic, yk.). It was
              <strong>extremely fast</strong>. Like, sound-speed fast (I was
              watching a Sonic video when I fell asleep, lmao). I was holding my
              phone with just my thumb and index finger, gripping it with all my
              strength but barely managing to keep it. At one point, I realized
              there was no way I’d be able to hold on and ended up letting it
              go. When the bike finally stopped, I realized it wasn’t my phone
              that I lost. It had actually been in my pocket the whole time.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that, while we were riding, another Uber bike showed up next
              to us. The driver and the passenger started talking to us, super
              casual, my driver and them just started a conversation. They were
              so close to us that we almost looked like a car. I was
              <strong>very anxious</strong> due to the weird situation. After
              that, we approached the "Death curve" ("Curva da Morte" - It's a
              well known road in my old neighborhood). While doing it I was
              holding onto my driver's backpack which he was wearing, but he was
              only using one of the straps, so I
              <strong>fell off the bike</strong> along with his backpack.
              Surprisingly, I landed on my feet, running, because of the
              momentum. The driver stopped and came back to me, noticed that my
              feet were all dirty with mud, and looked very disappointed.
            </p>
            <p>
              He got off the bike and for some reason I started driving it (I
              think. I'm not sure exactly when I started driving, but I
              eventually did). At this point, the Uber driver seemed
              uninterested in taking me home. We started going to weird
              dangerous areas (crime-wise). It was a long journey. I remember
              going to a bunch of places, dodging traffic, pushing the bike on
              foot, stuff like that. At one point we stopped and went inside
              this bar. It was full of
              <strong>goth Corintianas</strong> (Women who are into
              <a
                href="https://www.google.com/search?q=time+de+futebol+corinthians"
                >Corinthians</a
              >, the soccer team). I even said something like "I am going to
              come back here with my friends later". Me and the Uber driver
              started to become friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              We were almost at my place, and for some reason we were in this
              square on foot. It looked sketchy and was full of people. Suddenly
              some random person took the lollipop they were sucking and rubbed
              it on my arm. The Uber driver said it was
              <strong>Molly</strong> (the drug) and started freaking out, saying
              that I was gonna get super high and stuff. I told him not to
              worry, that it only kicks in after 30 minutes, and we were really
              close to my house. He calmed down and started leading me
              somewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we were walking I started to get high. Colors were more
              vivid. I was having fun and felt happier. I felt very good. He
              took me to his community and started showing me around and
              introducing me to people. He seemed like a big deal there and
              looked like he knew everyone. Then he introduced me to this woman
              and her daughter. Apparently she had
              <strong>depression</strong> and they wanted me to become friends
              with her. The last thing I remember was me talking to her.

            <h1>Review</h1>
            <p>
              Overall, it was a super fun dream. Felt like a long journey. I met
              a lot people and went a lot of places. When I woke up I wished it
              lasted longer. 10/10. Would dream it again.
