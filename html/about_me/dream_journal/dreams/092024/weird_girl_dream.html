            It started in a facility inside a treehouse. A lot of people lived
            there, kind of like a big house. I was with my friend João, and we
            decided to hang out and have lunch together. As we were leaving the
            treehouse, a woman spoke to me. I think she worked there, maybe in a
            shop or canteen; I’m not sure. The only thing I remember about her
            appearance is that she was blonde, with shoulder-length hair. She
            was very pretty. We had a short exchange, and I remember her
            laughing. Then my friend and I left.
          </p>
          <p>
            For three straight days, we just hung out, walked the streets,
            talked, and had lunch. It was a really good time. Each time we left
            the treehouse, the woman would talk to me. We really hit it off, and
            I was starting to like her.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the third day, she decided to join us for lunch. It was nice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Out of nowhere, on the fourth day, the scene changed. At the time,
            it made sense. Now we were in one of my relatives' houses in another
            city, and it was nighttime—just me and her in the kitchen 1.

            <p>
              The house was dark. She was leaning into the kitchen sink. We
              started talking.
            </p>
          </center>

          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Girl:</strong> I really like you, you smell like a good
            person. You’ve never gotten mad at me, never yelled at me, never
            hurt me in any way. I know I smell really bad because of sweat, and
            you didn’t even say anything. You’re so nice!
          </div>

          <center>
            <p>
              For some reason, she started to really creep me out, so I began to
              walk backwards.
            </p>
          </center>

          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Me:</strong> There was literally nothing I could have done.
            Literally nothing... What could I have done?
          </div>

          <center>
            <p>
              She smirked, giving me chills, and started walking towards me.
            </p>
          </center>

          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Girl:</strong> There were a lot of things you could have
            done.
          </div>

          <p>
            At that moment, I was really scared. I took off running down Hallway
            1, and she chased after me, fast. Suddenly, I started hearing the
            voices of my relatives all screaming at me at once—around ten voices
            shouting, “Come this way! Here! Come here!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I saw their initials flying around, showing me where they were,
            like a video game objective. Unfortunately, I was heading in the
            opposite direction. I turned back, rushing down Hallway 1 again,
            shoving the girl out of the way—it was terrifying. I ran into one of
            the bedrooms and saw one of my relatives calling me. I got close to
            them but was confused about what to do. Next thing I knew, I was in
            the living room.
          </p>
          <p>
            The girl wasn’t following me anymore, but there were a lot of
            unknown people acting very strangely, almost like zombies. I started
            jumping on the sofas to avoid them. Again, I noticed a symbol: a
            square filled with dots in a grid pattern. I knew exactly what I had
            to do. I screamed as loudly and as long as I could, completely
            emptying my lungs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I finished, all the “zombies” began to walk away slowly and
            leave the house. Suddenly, I woke up, feeling scared and confused.
          </p>

          <center>
            <p><strong>The End.</strong></p>
          </center>

            It was a good dream, solid 7/10. The first part was very nice. I had
            a lot of fun hanging out with my friend and the woman. The second
            part, though, was very scary and weird, and I didn't like the way I
            suddenly woke up.
