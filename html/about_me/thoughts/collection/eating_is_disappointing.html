          <h1>Eating Is So Disappointing</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Eating is so disappointing.</strong> I mean, don’t get me
            wrong, it's amazing. Eating something delicious feels so good, and
            even the thought of it makes your mouth water and stomach growl. But
            it always leaves me kinda disappointed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Imagine this:</i> You saw someone on the internet enjoying
            something that looks really good, and now, you’re <i>hungry</i>. You
            open your usual food app and spend some time deciding what to eat.
            Each option tempting you even more. Finally, you’ve decided on your
            favorite food and order it.
          </p>
          <p>
            You wait for it to arrive impatiently,
            <strong> getting hungrier and hungrier</strong>, and then, after
            what seems like forever, it's <i>finally</i> here. You grab it, full
            of expectation. It's been about an hour since the craving hit you,
            and that void in your stomach is killing you. But now -
            <i>it’s &nbsp; <strong>f i n a l l y</strong> &nbsp; here.</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            You take the first bite. It fills your mouth,
            <strong>absolutely delicious</strong>. You’re in <i>heaven</i>. It’s
            everything you expected and even more. Your taste buds are dancing,
            and you feel <strong>amazing</strong>. For a brief moment,
            everything is perfect. And then… <i>it’s over</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’re done eating. It was a very satisfying meal, but now, it’s
            <strong>over</strong>. All that expectation, all that waiting, for
            it to be over in 20 minutes... It’s as if it never happened, and you
            would almost question if it did, if not for the feeling of fullness
            you’re left with.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Was it worth it?</strong> Spending money, indulging in
            something unhealthy, building up all that anticipation, only for it
            to be over so fast? Idk bro, maybe I am just overthinking it, but I
            always wonder.
          </p>
          <p>
            I actually wanted to talk more about this, but I won’t. However, I
            did make a draft relating to this half a year ago.
