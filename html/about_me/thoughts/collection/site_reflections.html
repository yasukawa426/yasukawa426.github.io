          <h1>Site Reflections</h1>
          <p>
            Lately, I have been posting about video games and some random dreams
            that I had. But I've been thinking, that's not the reason why I made
            this site at all. The objective of this site is to post my deepest
            feelings and thoughts that I don't really share with people in my
            life, and that is what I'm going to focus on from now on. Of course,
            I won't stop posting about my hobbies and dreams, I will just focus
            a little bit more on what I said. After all, this is my
            publicÂ diary.Â  Yee ðŸ˜‰
