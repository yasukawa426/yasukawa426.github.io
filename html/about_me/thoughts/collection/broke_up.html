            <strong>First of all, a disclaimer:</strong> This post is a little
            bit (actually a lot) more personal than what I am confortable with
            sharing. But, lmao, who cares, right? Don't expect any bold stuff or
            neatly organized paragraphs to make this easier to digest. I’m just
            pouring my feelings out and then doing a quick revision. So, deal
            with it (also, kinda itxttd). And please, if you know me in real
            life, don’t reach out about this? If you don’t, feel free to lmao.
            Or do and don't lmao haha who cares wahtever idon't.

            So... I broke up with my girlfriend about 2-3 months ago. Our
            relationship lasted 3 years, and now, its over... Why? Well, I guess
            that is a good question, considering the title of this post. Our
            relationship was... kinda toxic. Even thought we loved each other a
            lot, we fought a lot. Just the way were, our way of thinking and
            beliefs were motive for fighting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our arguments were mostly about the same stuff, over and over, and
            over, and over, and over. We would start with a small disagreement
            that would quickly escalate into something much bigger. I’d express
            my concerns, and instead of finding a solution (even thought we
            tried), we’d end up getting more upset. It was like we were stuck in
            a loop of misunderstandings and hurt feelings.
          </p>
          <p>
            I remember one time she told me I always tried to be right and make
            her wrong. The problem was, in those moments, I genuinely tought I
            was right. After that, I couldn't defend myself without thinking, "I
            am doing it again, am I not?" And, of course, that was another
            motive for fighting, as always.
          </p>

            One thing about me, is that I really like drinking - getting drunk
            with my friends and hanging out, and sometimes even take something
            else. One thing about her is that she was "traumatized" by drugs and
            alcohol. When she was a kid, her dad was a drug dealer, drank a lot,
            and hit her mother. So, I guess it made sense. She asked me to give
            up on drinking, but I didn't really want to because of the fun, and
            it helped me with socializing (something that I really struggle
            with).
          </p>
          <p>
            I couldn't even hangout with my friends without her worrying about
            me drinking and whatever. Tons of times, I would argue with her
            while I was supposed to be having fun with my friends. It happened
            so often that my friends would get mad at me for spending so much
            time at my phone. Once, after a really long fight while I was
            drinking with my friends, I remember getting home and crying my eyes
            out. This video really comes to mind lol:
          </p>

          <p>
            Well, and??? Isn't it obvious? You're just incompatible. Just break
            up and be done with it. You see, I left out a very big part of the
            thing. She had a lot of mental problems: depression (took medicine
            for it), bipolarity, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. She had
            abused her meds and even ended up in the hospital because of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even thought I wanted to break up a year before, I always worried
            about what would happen to her. Would she take her life? Would she
            hurt herself even more? I felt responsible to be by her side and try
            to help her, even thought in the end, it just was bad for of both of
            us. I tried so much.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time I sacrificed my own mental health to try and support her.
            I would cry almost every day because of everything that happened,
            but I pretend everything was okay. Of course, she noticed, yet
            nothing changed, even after countless fights and arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while, I couldn’t take it anymore. I would be rude to her. I
            stopped caring. And, of course, she noticed. We fought, we cried,
            and I apologized and swore to be better to her. And then I wouldn't
            be able to take it anymore again. This endless cycle repeated over
            and over.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once, I started to ask her things, implying that I wanted to break
            up. Something like, “Should we really be together? We just hurt each
            other again and again”. She cried so much, begging me not to abandon
            her too. I never forgot it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, we loved each other so much. She, especially, adored me. I
            wanted to break up ages ago. Even though I loved her, I knew it was
            better for the both of us. But I was scared - what would happen to
            her? Would she be okay? Would she find someone else that could make
            her happy? And, even worse (as in me being selfish), what would
            happen to me? Would I be able to find someone else? It was so hard
            to find her. Would I be alone forever?
          </p>
          <p>
            And then the day came. I was travelling with my family - my
            grandama, my two brothers, and my cousin. I was trying to spend time
            with them,but we had some kind of fight that I don’t even remember.
            She cursed me, saying I was an “asshole” or something like that. And
            I, without hesitation, said:
          </p>

          <div class="dialog-box" style="text-align: center">
            We should take a break
          </div>

          <center><p>And she just answered:</p></center>

          <div class="dialog-box" style="text-align: center">Ok</div>

          <p>
            Yeah, I kinda lied to you. We didn't really break up, but took a
            break. Its been two months, thought. She reached out to me and asked
            for forgiveness, and then said her goodbyes. I didn't really tell
            her how I felt, tho. How I was worried about her, how I wanted to be
            friends, and everything I felt. And I feel like such an asshole for
            not reaching out to her, but at the same time, I don't have the guts
            to. And I feel so bad about myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, around two months later, I started dreaming about her. How we
            would start talking and feel so relieved, even thought I don't want
            to. I feel so lonely, worring about not being able to find anyone
            else to be my partner. I miss so much having someone to talk
            everyday and share all the minor stuff that happens with me. I guess
            I am happier overall; I don`t cry anymore, I hang out with my
            friends without feeling guilty. But I guess we are never satisfied,
            right?
          </p>

          <p>
            That's it. Maybe you're thinking that I am an asshole, alcoholic, or
            whatever. I just want to let you know that I left out so much and
            that I really suck at expressing my thoughts. There's a lot I didn't
            talk about. Like how I agreed to stop drinking while she treated
            herself with an psychologist that I would pay, that I tried
            everything to stop her from self-harming (even self-harming myself -
            yeah, that was dumb), how I broke down in front of my friends, how I
            would hide my feelings even after promising to tell her everything
            (thats a bad thing), how I thought I was the "strong one" mentally
            and could take anything while I tried to help her, etc, and blah
            blah blah. I probably wrote this making me look like the "correct
            one" and that she was the only "wrong one", but I am sure I did so
            many bad things too.
