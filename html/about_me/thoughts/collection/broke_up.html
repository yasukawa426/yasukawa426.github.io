          <p>
            First of all, a disclaimer: This post is a little bit (actually a
            lot) more personal than what I am confortable with sharing. I will
            do it anyway lmao haha who cares wahtever idon't. Don't expect me to
            add bold stuff and paragraphs to make it easier to understand tho. I
            am just pouring my feelings here and then doing a quick revision.
            So, deal with it (also kinda itxttd). Please, if you know me in real
            life, don't reach out to me about this? If you don't feel free to
            lmao.

            So... I broke up with my girlfriend around 2-3 months ago. Our
            relationship lasted 3 years, and now, its over... Why? Well, I guess
            that is a good question, given the name of this post. Our
            relationship was... kinda toxic. Even thought we loved each other a
            lot, we fought a lot. Just the way were, our way of thinking and
            beliefs were motive for fighting.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our arguments were mostly about the same stuff, over and over, and
            over, and over, and over. We would start with a small disagreement
            that would quickly escalate into something much bigger. I’d express
            my concerns, and instead of finding a solution (even thought we
            tried), we’d end up getting more upset. It was like we were stuck in
            a loop of misunderstandings and hurt feelings.
          </p>
          <p>
            We fought so much that I remember one time she told me I always
            tried to be right and make her wrong. The problem is, in those
            situations I really tought I was right. After that, I couldn't
            really defend myself without thinking "I am doing it again, am I
            not?" And, of course, that was another motive for fighting, as
            always.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing about me, is that I really like drinking. Get drunk with
            my friends and hangout, and sometimes even take something else. And
            one thing about her, is that she was "traumatized" with drugs and
            alcohol. When she was a kid, her dad was a drug dealer, drank a lot,
            and hit her mother. So, I guess it made sense. She asked me to give
            up on drinking, but I didn't really want to, because of the fun, and
            also because it helped me with socializing (something that I really
            struggle with).
          </p>
          <p>
            I couldn't even hangout with my friends that she would be worried
            about me drinking and whatever. Tons of times I would be arguing
            with her while I was supposed to be having fun with my friends. It
            happened so often that my friends would get mad at me for spending
            so much time at my phone. Once, after a really long fight while I
            was drinking with my friends, I remember just getting home and
            crying my eyes out. This video really comes to mind lol:
          </p>

          <p>
            Well, and??? Isn't it obvious? You're just incompatible. Just break
            up and be done with it. You see, I left out a very big part of the
            thing. She had a lot of mental problems. Depression (took medicine
            for it), bipolarity, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. She had
            abused her meds and even ended up in the hospital because of it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even thought I wanted to break up a year before, I always worried
            about what would be of her. Would she take her life? Would she hurt
            herself even more? I felt responsible to be at her side and try to
            help her, even thought at the end, it just was bad for the both of
            us. I tried so much
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time I sacrificed my own mental health to try and support her.
            I would cry almost everyday because of everything that happened, but
            pretend everything was okay. Of course, she noticed, yet, nothing
            changed, even after countless fights and arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while, I couldn’t take it anymore. I would be rude to her. I
            stopped caring. And, of course, she noticed. We fought, we cried,
            and I apologized and swore to be better to her. And then I wouldn't
            be able to take it anymore again. This endless cycle repeated again
            and again.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once, I started to ask her things, implying that I wanted to break
            things up. Something like “Should we really be together? We just
            hurt each other again and again”. She cried so much, begging me not
            to abandon her too. I never forgot it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, we loved each other so much. She, especially, adored me. I
            wanted to break up ages ago, even though I loved her, I knew it was
            better for the both of us. But I was scared, what would happen to
            her? Would she be okay? Would she find someone else that could make
            her happy? And, even worse, what would be of me? Would I be able to
            find someone else? it was so hard to find her. Would I be alone
            forever?
          </p>
          <p>
            And then, the day came. I was travelling with my family. My
            grandama, my two brothers, and my cousin. I was trying to spend time
            with them,but we had some kind of fight that I don’t even remember,
            she cursed me, saying that I was an “asshole” or something like
            that. And I, without hesitation, said:
          </p>

          <div class="dialog-box" style="text-align: center">
            We should take a break
          </div>

          <center><p>And she just answred:</p></center>

          <div class="dialog-box" style="text-align: center">Ok</div>

          <p>
            Yeah, I kinda lied to you. We didn't really break up but took a
            break. Its been two months thought. She reached out to me and asked
            for forgiveness, and then said her goodbyes. I didn't really tell
            her what I felt tho. How I was worried about her, how I wanted to be
            friends, and everything I felt. And I feel such an asshole for not
            reaching out to her, but at the same time, I don't have the guts to.
            And I feel so bad about myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, around two months later I started dreaming about her. How we
            would start talking about and feel so relieved even thought I don't
            want to. I feel so lonely, worring about not being able to find
            anyone else to be my partner. I miss so much having someone to talk
            everyday and show all the minor stuff that happen with me. I guess I
            am happier overall, I don`t cry anymore, I hangout with my friends
            with no guilty. But I guess we are never satisfied, right?
          </p>

          <p>
            That's it. Maybe you're thinking that I am an asshole, alcoholic, or
            whatever. I just want to let you know that I left out so much and
            that I really suck at expressing my thoughts. There's a lot I didn't
            talk about. Like how I agreed to stop drinking while she treated
            herself with an psychologist that I would pay, that I tried
            everything to stop her from self-harming (even self-harming myself.
            Yeah, that was dumb), how I broke out in front of my friends, how I
            would hide my feelings even after promising to tell her everything
            (thats a bad thing), how I thought I was the "strong one" mentally
            and could take anything while I tried to help her, etc and blah blah
            blah. I problaby wrote this making me look like the "correct one"
            and that she was the only "wrong one", but I am sure I did also so
            many bad things.
