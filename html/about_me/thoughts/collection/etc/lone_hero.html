          <h1>The Lonely Hero</h1>
          <p>
            In a forgotten corner of the world, nestled in the shadow of jagged
            mountains, a lone village clung to existence. This was the
            birthplace of Eryon, a boy who had lived his entire life as an
            outsider. His parents had died when he was but five, leaving him
            with nothing but an empty home and a heart that had never learned
            how to connect with others.
          </p>
          <p>
            The villagers spoke of Eryon’s peculiar silence, not with malice,
            but with curiosity. To them, he was quiet and withdrawn, a boy with
            a sadness in his eyes. Yet, no one dared to intrude on his solitude.
            Offers of companionship were met with averted gazes and mumbled
            replies, leaving the villagers unsure how to reach him. To Eryon,
            every kind word felt like pity, every glance like judgment. His
            isolation was not born of cruelty but of walls he’d built himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            One fateful evening, a blight swept through the land, bringing the
            demon king, Maltheron, to power. His dark magic poisoned rivers,
            blackened fields, and unleashed horrors upon the realm. When the
            demon king abducted the princess—the last hope of a unified
            resistance—no champion rose to the challenge. No one but Eryon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Driven by a sense of duty he didn’t fully understand, Eryon left the
            village with nothing but a rusty sword and a heart pounding with
            dread.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eryon’s adventure was unlike the stories of heroic epics. He avoided
            towns and settlements, unable to bear the thought of asking for
            help. The mere prospect of speaking to strangers left his stomach in
            knots and his chest tight.
          </p>
          <p>
            He saw bustling marketplaces from afar, heard the laughter of
            adventurers in taverns, and passed homes where warm fires glowed
            through windows. But to Eryon, every smile, every conversation, was
            a reminder of his inability to belong. He convinced himself that no
            one would understand, that any attempt at connection would end in
            failure. The loneliness wasn’t inflicted upon him; he carried it
            within, feeding it with every step.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, he scavenged and hunted, stitching crude armor from animal
            hides and fashioning weapons from branches and stones. The nights
            were the hardest. He slept fitfully beneath the stars, haunted by
            dreams of the village and a gnawing loneliness that made the
            wilderness feel endless.
          </p>
          <p>
            He encountered people in need—farmers besieged by bandits, travelers
            caught in magical storms—but each time, his feet froze, and his
            tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. Guilt followed him like a
            shadow. He told himself they would be better off without him, that
            his help would only make things worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            After months of solitude and hardship, Eryon reached the demon
            king’s fortress—a monolithic structure of obsidian and fire. Inside,
            he found the throne room where Maltheron awaited, shrouded in an
            aura of darkness that seemed to pulse with malevolence.
          </p>
          <p>
            The princess, bound and weary, watched from a corner. Her eyes
            pleaded for rescue, but Eryon couldn’t meet them. His heart raced,
            and his hands trembled as he faced the demon king.
          </p>
          <p>
            But instead of attacking, Maltheron paused. His piercing eyes
            softened as he observed Eryon.
          </p>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>You’re trembling.
          </div>
          <center>
            <p>The demon king said, his voice a deep, resonant echo.</p>
          </center>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>Your breath is uneven. Your gaze avoids
            mine. You... are afraid.
          </div>
          <center>
            <p>Eryon flinched but said nothing.</p>
            <p>Maltheron’s lips curled into a sardonic smile.</p>
          </center>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>I know that fear. That suffocating
            silence. The weight of being... alone.
          </div>
          <center>
            <p>The words cut through Eryon like a blade.</p>
          </center>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>I, too, was abandoned.
          </div>
          <center>
            <p>Maltheron continued.</p>
          </center>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>Left to rot in the darkness. Mocked,
            rejected, forgotten. I clawed my way to power not for domination,
            but for... company. And now, here you are—an echo of myself. A soul
            as isolated as my own.
          </div>
          <center>
            <p>Eryon’s grip on his sword faltered.</p>
          </center>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>You came here to kill me, didn’t you?
          </div>
          <center>
            <p>Maltheron asked.</p>
          </center>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>But why fight, when we are the same?
            Together, we could end this cycle of rejection. The world has never
            cared for us, so why should we care for it?
          </div>
          <center>
            <p>
              Eryon’s mind raced. He thought of the villagers who had tried to
              reach him, the people he had failed to help, and the princess, who
              barely looked at him now. Every moment of isolation was his own
              doing, but the weight of it had crushed him all the same.
            </p>
          </center>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>Rule with me...
          </div>
          <p>
            <center>Maltheron offered, his hand outstretched.</center>
          </p>
          <div class="dialog-box">
            <strong>Maltheron: </strong>Let us create a world where we
            belong—even if it’s a world of ashes.
          </div>
          <p>
            Eryon hesitated, but in the void of his heart, he found no
            alternative. For the first time, someone understood him—not in a
            superficial, fleeting way, but wholly.
          </p>
          <p>He dropped his sword.</p>
          <p>
            Together, the hero and the demon king unleashed devastation.
            Kingdoms fell, and humanity was wiped from existence. The princess
            perished with the rest, her pleas unheard by a hero who had given up
            on saving anyone but himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the years that followed, Eryon and Maltheron lived as the last
            beings in a silent world. They shared stories, laughed, and mourned
            their pasts together. For the first time, neither felt alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            When their time came, they died side by side, leaving behind a
            barren planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus ended the tale of the lonely hero, the demon king, and humanity
            itself—a bittersweet tragedy of connection found too late.
