            This gonna be a big page, so here is a Table of Content to help you
            navigate:
          </p>
          <table class="toc">
            <tr>
              <th>Section</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th><a href="#how_judge">How I Judge</a></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </table>

          <h2>How I Judge Anime</h2>
          <p>
            I donâ€™t judge anime just by production quality or how flashy the
            animation is. Sure, soundtracks, voice actors, and visuals matter,
            but what really counts for me is
            <strong>enjoyment, vibes, and the characters</strong>. I care about
            how fleshed out the characters are, their dynamics and
            relationships, and the moments that make me laugh, cry, or think.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, <strong>Attack on Titan</strong> has a well written and
            complex story, great visuals and soundtracks (the ops are extremely
            iconic), but I enjoyed <strong> Chainsaw Man </strong> more . I just
            love all the characters from the show, their interecations,
            countless emotional moments. Bro, I'm literally Denji man (jk).
          </p>
          <p>
            Bro is just pissed at people disrespecting his dream of fondling
            some boobs, and makes a fking epic discourse about it in the middle
            of a fight (I'm not even gonna get into how this dream is actually
            about wanting intimacy and love... I actually will later lmao).
            Absolute peak, especially the portuguese dub.

          <p>
            Man... I love this show. So many good moments and characters. A
            couple of sad ones that make you think too. But enought, let's get
            back to the tierlist.
          </p>
          <p id="judge_order">
            In conclusion, my order of judging criteria would be something like
            this:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Characters</strong>: How fleshed out they are, their
              relationships, interactions, how I connect with them, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Enjoyment/Fun: </strong> Did I laugh, cry, get hyped,
              think. Emotions in general.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Production Quality: </strong> Animation, soundtracks,
              voice acting. Its not the most important thing for me, but it does
              add to the experience. Nobody wants to watch a show with Berserk
              2016 or Nanatsu no Taizai's season 4 animation quality (even tho I
              did).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Story/Plot: </strong>It doesn't hurt to have a good and
              complex story. Made in Abyss and Attack on Titan, for example, are
              great because of it. But as long as the anime doesn't have a
              horrible story, full of plot holes and inconsistencies, I'm fine
              with it, if they have something else going for them, of course.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Keep in mind that while they're are in order of importance,
            <strong>ALL</strong> of them are important.
