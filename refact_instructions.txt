First of all, we want to host our entire website in a new folder, and for github pages, the folder needs to be call "docs"

We will separe the site in 2 folders: layout and content

layout will contain all repeating/boilerplate html code. Navbar, footer, etc.
plus a placeholder ({{title}} and {{content}}) that will later be replaced by the actual page html code

For example: 
layout.html
<head>
imports, css and stuff
<title>{{title}}</title>
</head>
<main>
navbar
{{content}}
footer

-----------------
content will have all our page without the boilerplate codes contained in the layout.html
for exmaple:

index.html

<!-- title: Sadboy's Place -->
<h1>Welcome to my Website!</h1>
<p>This is my home bla bla c bla</p>
-----------------
And there will be a .py builder script that will take all content, insert into the layout.html and output to the "docs" folder.

-------

1: Change all absolute paths (eg: <a href=/html/page.html>) to relative paths (<a href=page.html)

2: Create the layout file - css import, navbar, footer, etc.

3: Create the build script - The script will:

Walk content/ recursively.

Wrap each page in layout.html.

Copy raw/ folders as-is.

Ignore templates/.

4: Create the content folder - It should have the same struct of the actual site minus the boilerplate code. So I can just copy and paste evrything and then go removing stuff that are not the actual content.

5: Any page that I don't want to use layout.html should go into a separe "raw" folder. These will just be copied into the output folder
Example: 
raw/my_games/pong_clone
raw/my_games/snake

6: Resources folder should be separed from content and layout, just like it is now. Maybe move css to resources fodler.

7: Build - run the build script

8: Push to github and config pages to use the new "docs" folder.
